# Vegan-Digital-Library
The Vegan Digital Library is an ebook (to avoid deforestation of trees for paper) library with a catalog of free ebooks (with an option to donate) - to help educate people on veganism quicker. Anyone can create their own vegan books too, not just read everyone else's.

refer to https://github.com/BrittanyBunk/web-scraper for the scraping of various sites for their vegan book list.
